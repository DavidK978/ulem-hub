# ULEMHub
We are building a website for the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts. It will be called ULEMHub.

## General Info
ULEMHub will provide top news, upcoming events, helpful information, sports, and have a search engine for browsing.

## Problem Summary
A client asked us to build a website with just HTML and CSS. They want us to make it look similar to [www.yahoo.com](www.yahoo.com).


## Process and Solution
First, we started off by looking at yahoo.com and coming up with ways to set up the page.
We also look at ulem.org to find out the colors and other styles we should use.
Then we worked on a couple wireframes to help us use as a guide before we start coding.

We split up the work.
1. Homepage and News sections (David).
2. Coronavirus article and Sports sections (Gregory).

We ran into a few issues with our codes. For example, images weren't lining up correctly or objects were out of place.
Took some time to figure it out by playing around with the codes in the css file.

Once we finished all of our pages, we made sure these pages linked correctly.
