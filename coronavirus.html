        <h3>-Boston Response</h3>
        <p>The COVID-19 vaccine is an important tool to keep ourselves and our communities safe. Along with wearing masks, social distancing, and frequent handwashing, the vaccine will help us end the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
        <p>Since January, the Boston Public Health Commission and Boston EMS have taken extensive steps to prepare for a potential outbreak of COVID-19. BPHC and Boston EMS are trained to respond to infectious diseases. In the past, we have successfully stood up heightened awareness, monitoring and response approaches for SARS, MERS, and H1N1 flu. We will do the same for COVID-19.</p>
        <p>BPHC is engaging in daily communications with the CDC, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH), City of Boston departments and other community partners to make sure we have the latest information on guidance, best practices and recommendations. BPHC will provide updated information on this website and on our social media channels as it becomes available.</p>
        <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of three vaccines to prevent COVID-19: one for people 12 years of age and two others for people over age 18. Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital expects to receive limited amounts of COVID-19 vaccine from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Per state guidance, health care workers will be the first group to receive the vaccine. Careful planning is ongoing to ensure staff receiving the vaccine are prioritized in accordance with state guidelines.</p>
